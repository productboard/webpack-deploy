# Webpack deploy utilities
Collection of useful utilities for deploying (not only) Webpack apps

## Installation
```
cd $YOUR_PROJECT
npm install --save-dev productboard/webpack-deploy
````

## Configuration
Copy `deploy-config-example.js` and `secrets-example.js` into the root of your
project and fit them to your needs.
Also make sure you have `./node_modules/.bin` in your `$PATH`.

The script will automatically detect the build hash from `build.log`.

### Why Bash with Gulp?
Gulp is great for building, Bash for running tasks.

### NPM >= 5.2.0 required
To find gulp binary also in mono-repos, `npx` is used. `npx` is included with npm from version 5.2.0.
